</div>

Genuine insights happen while you're deep in code. By the time you open Twitter, the moment's gone and you're staring at a blank box. This captures them in-context and drafts content without breaking flow.

```bash
claude plugins install nardovibecoding/claude-social-pipeline
```

## What It Does

The best content comes from real work. This plugin makes it frictionless to capture insights as they happen, humanize drafts before publishing, and post from the terminal — without breaking flow.

**The pipeline:**

```
coding session
     │
     ├── interesting thing happens
     │       └── content_capture("discovered X")
     │                   └── ~/.claude/content_drafts/running_log.md
     │
     ├── session getting long
     │       └── session_checkpoint("built Y")
     │                   └── ~/.claude/content_drafts/checkpoint_ts.md
     │
     ├── task complete
     │       └── post_task_check()
     │                   └── "content-worthy: use content_capture"
     │
     └── ready to post
             └── /tweet suggest
                         └── git log → privacy filter → draft
                                     └── humanizer → approve → X API
```

## MCP Tools

Six tools Claude calls automatically during your session — no slash commands needed.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `content_capture` | Save a tweet-worthy moment mid-session. Appends to `running_log.md` with timestamp and context. |
| `content_queue` | Manage tweet drafts — add, list, get next, mark posted. Priority-sorted queue. |
| `session_checkpoint` | Snapshot session state (summary, decisions, files changed) before `/clear` or context limit. |
| `post_task_check` | After finishing a task — scan session for content-worthy material and improvement patterns. |
| `set_reminder` | Terminal alert with no background service: `"30m"`, `"2h"`, or `"16:55"` (HKT). |
| `tweet_performance` | Pull engagement stats for recent tweets — likes, retweets, replies, views, engagement score. Auto-captures best performer to content log. |

## Skills

### `/tweet` — x-tweet

Draft, humanize, and post tweets. Runs every post through a multi-step pipeline before anything reaches the API.

**Pipeline:** git log → privacy filter → voice rules → content-humanizer → anti-pattern scan → manual approval → X API v2

**Modes:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tweet [topic]` | Draft from a topic, approve, post |
| `/tweet suggest` | Read git log, surface privacy-safe angles |
| `/tweet hot` | Search X for trending topics in your space |
| `/tweet draft` | Save to queue without posting |
| `/tweet queue` | View and pick from saved drafts |
| `/tweet thread` | Generate a 3–5 tweet thread |

**Never auto-posts.** Every tweet requires explicit approval before the X API is called.

**Env vars required:**
```env
X_API_KEY=your_key
X_API_SECRET=your_secret
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
```

---

### `content-humanizer`

Detects and removes AI writing patterns. Not a word-swap tool — it rebuilds voice from the ground up using a two-pass approach.

**Triggers:** `"sounds like AI"`, `"make it human"`, `"add personality"`, `"too generic"`, `"fix AI writing"`

**How it works:**

1. `humanizer_scorer.py` runs a 12-point checklist: filler words, hedge phrases, em-dash overuse, passive constructions, hollow intensifiers, and more
2. Produces a score (0–100) and a list of specific tells
3. Rewriter addresses each tell with concrete changes — not paraphrasing

**Before / After:**

```
BEFORE (AI score: 31/100)
"It's worth noting that this approach leverages cutting-edge techniques
to significantly enhance performance. The implementation showcases a
robust solution that addresses the core challenges effectively."

AFTER (AI score: 89/100)
"This drops response time by 40%. The trick: cache the embedding lookup
instead of recomputing on every request. Obvious in hindsight."
```
